## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: AI recommendations not accurate enough for user satisfaction
**Mitigation**: Start with curated experiences and rule-based matching, gradually add ML

**Risk**: Booking platform integration more complex than expected
**Mitigation**: Begin with simple deep links, enhance integration over time

**Risk**: App performance issues with complex mood calculations
**Mitigation**: Implement caching strategy and offline-first architecture

### Market Risks
**Risk**: Major travel companies launch competing mood-based features
**Mitigation**: Build strong user loyalty and superior AI capabilities first

**Risk**: User acquisition costs higher than sustainable for business model
**Mitigation**: Focus on organic growth, viral features, and partnership channels

**Risk**: Booking conversion rates lower than financial projections
**Mitigation**: Continuously optimize recommendation relevance and booking UX

### Business Risks
**Risk**: Difficulty securing favorable booking platform partnerships
**Mitigation**: Start with available APIs, prove value before negotiating better terms

**Risk**: Seasonal travel spending affecting revenue predictability
**Mitigation**: Diversify into local experiences and year-round travel planning

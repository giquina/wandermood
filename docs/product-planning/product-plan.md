# WanderMood Product Plan 📋

## 1. App Concept Summary

WanderMood is an AI-powered mobile app that revolutionizes travel discovery by matching experiences to users' emotional states. Instead of browsing endless destination lists, users simply share their current mood through intuitive inputs (emoji, sliders, or quick check-ins), and WanderMood's AI curates personalized travel experiences that resonate with their emotional needs. Whether someone feels stressed and needs a peaceful retreat, bored and craves adventure, or romantic and wants intimate getaways, WanderMood acts as an emotionally intelligent travel concierge that understands not just where you want to go, but how you want to feel when you get there.

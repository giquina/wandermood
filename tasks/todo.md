## 🎯 Critical Path Items
**These items block multiple downstream tasks and should be prioritized:**

1. **Database Setup (1.1.1-1.1.3)** - Blocks all backend development
2. **Mood API (1.3.1)** - Blocks UI development and testing
3. **Authentication (1.2.1)** - Blocks user features and testing
4. **Core UI Components (2.1.1, 2.2.1)** - Blocks user testing and optimization

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Implement caching layer if queries exceed targets
- **API Integration**: Have fallback data if external APIs fail
- **Mobile Performance**: Progressive enhancement ensures core functionality works

### Timeline Risks  
- **Scope Creep**: Defer nice-to-have features to post-MVP
- **Integration Issues**: Build comprehensive integration tests early
- **Resource Constraints**: Parallel workstreams where dependencies allow
